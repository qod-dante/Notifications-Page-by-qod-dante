## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow (Still trying to learn this)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Well... I just used this project to learn more about JavaScript. I'm still on the bare-bone basics, but I hope to learn more with the
next projects of Frontend Mentor.

### Continued development

Definitely want to learn more JavaScript, especially focusing more on Functions, Arrow Functions, all kinds of Loops, Arrays, Objects, and
more on the DOM.

On CSS I want learn about Animations, Tooltips, Transitions and Transforms.

Once I feel confident enough with the 2 above, I really want to start learning SASS and react.js, then eventuall start learning backend web development.

### Useful resources

Again, aside from [W3 Schools](https://w3schools.com), I did not use any other external resource... it's all just pure. Hard. Code.
